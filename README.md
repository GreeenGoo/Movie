Movie is an application that shows a list of the most popular movies (rating from the website https://www.themoviedb.org/) and gives us info on each of them. Just scroll through the list and choose the film to know its details.


Just open your application and see the list of popular movies. There are the first twenty movies from the website list. If you scrolled until 17, the app's list will be refreshed with the next twenty movies from the website. To see detailed information about a movie just press on the movie in the list and a new window will be opened to show the info. There is some information like a quote, release date, genres of movie, runtime, vote, etc. Come back to the previous page if you want to choose another movie.
